# Confidence Aware Occupancy Grid Mapping
ROS package implementing 3D mapping using octomap.

![Octomap](https://github.com/Lolu28/smap/raw/octomap/error_plot.png)

Evolution of error from SMAP and Log-Odds-based mapping over 500 iterations. The voxels of size 0.125 are aligned in a 32 x 32 x 32 occupancy grid.
SMAP is using a forward sensor model with std dev of 0.15.
