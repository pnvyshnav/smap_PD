# SMAP Evaluation

This components is used for generating plots from the [smapStats](./msg/smapStats.msg) bag file
generated by [Statistics.cpp](./src/Statistics.cpp).

## Full Error (MAE) Evolution

Experiments with different observation noise std deviations compared to Log-Odds-based mapping:

Error evolution for the noise std deviations from the ICRA 2016 paper:

Even for very intensive noise levels like std=0.5 (voxel size is only 0.1),
SMAP ultimately converges and outperforms Log Odds:

## Distribution of Errors

To get better insights, how belief or Log Odds are updated at every step, in the following,
only the *updated* voxels are considered
that lie on the ray from the sensor position up until (and including) the first *occupied* voxel.

The following diagram visualizes the histogram of errors at every step.
1600 steps were executed which equates to almost 21 full rotations of the robot in the environment.
Note how Log Odds errors are clustered along a line at about 0.12.
After trying many different ISM parameters, it was not possible to improve Log Odds in the way that more errors
would be distributed below this cluster.
